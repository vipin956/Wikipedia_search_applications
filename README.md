# Wikipedia_search_applications
Wikipedia Search Application in Python  This project involves creating a Wikipedia search application using Python. It includes two versions: a command-line interface and a GUI built with Tkinter. Users can input search terms, and the application fetches and displays summaries from Wikipedia. Key features include real-time search results.
Project Overview:
This project involves creating a Wikipedia search application using Python. The application allows users to search for topics on Wikipedia and displays the corresponding summaries.

Features:

	•	Command-Line Interface: A simple text-based interface for users to input search terms and receive Wikipedia summaries.
	•	Graphical User Interface (GUI): A more user-friendly version built with Tkinter, providing an intuitive way to search and view results.
	•	Real-Time Search Results: Fetches and displays summaries from Wikipedia in real-time based on user input.

Technologies Used:

	•	Python: The primary programming language used for both versions of the application.
	•	Tkinter: A standard Python library used to create the graphical user interface.
	•	Wikipedia API: Used to fetch search results and summaries from Wikipedia.

Learning Outcomes:

	•	Understanding how to interact with web APIs in Python.
	•	Developing both command-line and GUI-based applications.
	•	Enhancing problem-solving and debugging skills.

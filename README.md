# Wikipedia_search_applications
Wikipedia Search Application in Python  This project involves creating a Wikipedia search application using Python. It includes two versions: a command-line interface and a GUI built with Tkinter. Users can input search terms, and the application fetches and displays summaries from Wikipedia. Key features include real-time search results.
